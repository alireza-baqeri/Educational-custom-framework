# Educational Website - Custom Responsive Framework

This is a very simple one-page website that serves as the homepage of an educational website.  
The main purpose of this project was to practice responsive design and layout structure without relying on frameworks like Bootstrap.

## 🌟 What's interesting?

Instead of using a pre-built CSS framework, I created a **custom responsive framework** using **CSS media queries**.  
It behaves similarly to Bootstrap in terms of grid responsiveness and layout adaptability across devices.

## 💡 Features

- Pure HTML & CSS
- Custom responsive grid system
- Media queries for different screen sizes
- Simple and clean design
- Lightweight and easy to understand
